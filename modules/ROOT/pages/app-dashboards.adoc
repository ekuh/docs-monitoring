Built-in dashboards display deployment information about your application at the top of the screen and provide access to a number of different graphs, for example:

image::dashboard-built-in-info.png[Deployment Info on an App in a Built-In Dashboard]

The graphs and tables in built-in dashboards support a number of metrics, including application metrics. The *Overview* tab provides overall measures. You can view more granular application metrics through the *Inbound*, *Outbound*, and *Failure* tabs.

Example use cases for monitoring are end-to-end tracing of API calls and dependency analyses to help you isolate the source of issues. For example, you can track response times at each endpoint (outbound or inbound).

.Example: Average Response Time Grouped by Endpoint Outbound
image::dashboard-outbound-response-table.png[Average Response Time Grouped By Endpoint Outbound]

* Infrastructure-level and JVM metrics
* Performance metrics that break down inbound and outbound response times into averages and percentiles

== View a Built-in Dashboard

Built-in and custom dashboards are available from Anypoint Monitoring. You can view application metrics for applications deployed to CloudHub and to hybrid targets in both built-in and custom dashboards.

. Sign into Anypoint Platform and click *Monitoring*.
. Select the *Environment* and *Resource name* for the app or API to view the corresponding dashboard.
. Click *View*. +
The built-in dashboard for the application or API is displayed.
. To switch to a dashboard for a different resource, click the built-in dashboard selector at the top of the page.

[[overview-charts]]
== Overview

The following charts appear on the *Overview* dashboard:

Inbound - Total Requests by Response Type::
The sum of inbound requests, grouped by type of response in automatic intervals. Responses are OK or Failed. If a Mule app has more than one connector type, all types are included in this metric.

Inbound - Average Response Time::
The average response time of inbound requests, grouped by application in automatic intervals. If a Mule app has more than one connector type, all types are included in this metric.

Mule Messages::
The sum of Mule messages that are processed successfully, grouped by application.

Outbound - Total Requests by Response Type::
The sum of outbound requests, grouped by type of response in automatic intervals. Responses are OK or Failed. If a Mule app has more than one connector type, all types are included in this metric.

Outbound - Average Response Time::
The average response time of outbound requests, grouped by application in automatic intervals. If a Mule app has more than one connector type, all types are included in this metric.

JVM - CPU utilization::
The average percentage of CPU utilized by the JVM, grouped by worker in automatic intervals. The JVM used in this chart is the Mule runtime JVM process. The calculation for CPU utilization is relative to the physical server on which the Mule runtime is deployed. For example, in RTF, the resource usage here indicates the the JVM's utilization with respect to the entire server, and not with respect to the Pod maximum CPU allocation.

JVM - Heap memory utilization::
The average amount of heap memory utilized by the JVM, grouped by worker in automatic intervals. The JVM used in this chart is the Mule runtime JVM process.

JVM - Thread count::
The average number of threads of the JVM, grouped by worker in automatic intervals. The JVM used in this chart is the Mule runtime JVM process.
