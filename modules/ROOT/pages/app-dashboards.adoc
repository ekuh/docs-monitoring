endif::[]

Built-in dashboards display deployment information about your application at the top of the screen and provide access to a number of different graphs, for example:

image::dashboard-built-in-info.png[Deployment Info on an App in a Built-In Dashboard]

The graphs and tables in built-in dashboards support a number of metrics, including application metrics. The *Overview* tab provides overall measures. You can view more granular application metrics through the *Inbound*, *Outbound*, and *Failure* tabs.

Example use cases for monitoring are end-to-end tracing of API calls and dependency analyses to help you isolate the source of issues. For example, you can track response times at each endpoint (outbound or inbound).

.Example: Average Response Time Grouped by Endpoint Outbound
image::dashboard-outbound-response-table.png[Average Response Time Grouped By Endpoint Outbound]

* Infrastructure-level and JVM metrics
* Performance metrics that break down inbound and outbound response times into averages and percentiles

== View a Built-in Dashboard

Built-in and custom dashboards are available from Anypoint Monitoring. You can view application metrics for applications deployed to CloudHub and to hybrid targets in both built-in and custom dashboards.

. Sign into Anypoint Platform and click *Monitoring*.
. Select the *Environment* and *Resource name* for the app or API to view the corresponding dashboard.
. Click *View*. +
The built-in dashboard for the application or API is displayed.
. To switch to a dashboard for a different resource, click the built-in dashboard selector at the top of the page.
