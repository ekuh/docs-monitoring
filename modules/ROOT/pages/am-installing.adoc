Install the Anypoint Monitoring agent on an on-premises server to monitor applications that are running on that server and managed in the cloud. 

The Anypoint Monitoring agent sends monitoring data to the Anypoint Monitoring cloud endpoint. Anypoint Monitoring data is transferred using an open-source protocol for transferring log data over a highly-efficient bidirectional binary channel. Data is securely transmitted using mutual TLS encryption. 

== Before You Begin

If you have an outbound firewall, open ports 443 and 5044. 

Outbound connections are made to the following endpoints:

* US Control Plane
** arm-auth-proxy.prod.cloudhub.io:443
** dias-ingestor-nginx.prod.cloudhub.io:5044
* EU Control Plane
** arm-auth-proxy.prod-eu.msap.io:443
** dias-ingestor-nginx.prod-eu.msap.io:5044

== Supported Operating Systems

Ensure that Anypoint Monitoring is installed on a server running one of the following operating systems:

* CentOS 7
* RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.0 and 7.6
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2019

== Supported Versions of Mule Runtime Engine

A supported version of Mule must be running on the server. Supported versions of Mule include: 

* 4.x.x
* 3.9.x
* 3.8.7-AM

== Supported Versions of Mule Runtime Manager Agent

Ensure that one of the following Mule Runtime Manager agent versions is installed in the Mule runtime engine running on the server:

* 2.3.0
* 2.2.1
* 2.2.0
* 2.1.9
* 2.1.7
* 2.1.6
* 1.11.3
* 1.11.2
* 1.11.1
* 1.11.0
* 1.10.0

== Hardware Prerequisites

Ensure that the server has the minimum hardware requirements for Anypoint Monitoring, which are:

* 2GHz CPU or 1 virtual CPU
* 1GB RAM
* 4GB disk space
* Intel x86 or x64 compatible CPU architecture

== Install the Anypoint Monitoring agent

Instructions for downloading and installing the Anypoint Monitoring agent on-premises are located on the xref:monitoring-settings-page.adoc[*Settings* page] of the Anypoint Monitoring user interface. You can also download the Anypoint Monitoring installation `am.zip` file from the *Settings* page. 

When you extract the `am.zip` file, a folder called `am` is created in the location where you extracted the ZIP. 

The installation script asks if you want Anypoint Monitoring installed as a service. If you don't want to have it preset as a service by the installer, select `no`. 

You can also call the installation script with the `-x` argument to skip this prompt. If you skip the prompt, Anypoint Monitoring is not installed as a service. 


== SOCKS5 Proxy Setting

If you need to proxy your monitoring data as it leaves the data center, you can use the command line parameter `-p` when you install the Anypoint Monitoring agent. 

To use the SOCKS5 protocol for monitoring, you must:

. Set up Runtime Manager with a proxy. See xref:runtime-manager::servers-create.adoc[Create a Server in Runtime Manager].
. To perform the SOCKS5 proxy configuration step, you must have a compatible server deployed to your environment.
. Install the Anypoint Monitoring agent and use the `-p` option. For example, on a Windows server, at the command line, enter: 

----
<location-of-am-folder\bin>powershell -file install.ps1 -s <server-id> -p socks5://user:password@socks5-server:1080
----

For a Linux server, enter:

----
$ ./install -s <server-id> -p socks5://user:password@socks5-server:1080
---- 


== Verify the Anypoint Monitoring Agent is Running

1. Wait 10 minutes for the configuration to propagate.
1. Go to http://anypoint.mulesoft.com and sign in.
1. Navigate to *Monitoring*.
1. On the *Built-in Dashboards* page, select an app that is deployed on the server where you installed the Anypoint Monitoring agent.
1. Check whether the CPU Utilization and Memory Utilization charts are displaying data. +
If you see data in the charts, the Anypoint Monitoring agent is installed and running. +
If you do not see data in the charts, verify that Anypoint Monitoring is able to connect to the endpoint. +
[NOTE]
If necessary, you can whitelist the endpoint for outbound firewall rules so your server allows connections. The endpoint is displayed in the gray box in Step 5 on the page, under the OS.
11. Log into the server on which the Anypoint Monitoring agent is running.
11. Open the log file for the data-transfer agent. The log file is in this path: `./am/filebeat/logs`
11. Look for entries that mention connection failures or connection retries.

== Update the Anypoint Monitoring Agent

If you need to update the Anypoint Monitoring agent at some point in the future, follow these steps.

. Make sure to stop Mule Runtime
. In the `am` folder, run the following command: +
`./bin/uninstall script`
. Delete the `am` folder.
. Follow the instructions for <<install_ap_monitoring_onprem,installing the Anypoint Monitoring agent>> on-premises. 

== Performance Impact

Enabling Monitoring can impact CPU utilization and memory utilization, which varies depending upon specific application configuration. MuleSoft recommends that you test any performance impact in your pre-production environment prior to enabling monitoring in your production environment to ensure optimal performance and sizing.

== What to do Next

- If you find connection failure or retry entries, ensure that ports 443 and 5044 in your outbound firewall are open.
- If you do not find connection failure or retry entries, contact MuleSoft technical support.
